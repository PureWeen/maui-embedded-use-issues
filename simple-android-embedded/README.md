## Simple Android Embedded

The `simple-android-embedded` directory contains the solution for running a native .NET Android application with embedded MAUI outside of the single project structure (better representing how we actually use it).

This supports the same actions as `simple-maui-embedded` but will show that trying to use a grouped list throws an exception in Android outside of the signle project structure.
