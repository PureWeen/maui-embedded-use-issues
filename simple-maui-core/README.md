## Simple MAUI Core

The `simple-maui-core` directory contains just a simple project to house all the MAUI pages, view models, etc. so they could be shared between the single project embedded example and the sepatate .NET Android example.
This is in line with our real world use of a shared project for the MAUI code to be referenced by the individual Android and iOS projects.
